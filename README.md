# 🌍 Whaleport: Sustainable Development Strategy – Turbines vs. Trawlers

This project outlines a data-informed policy and design framework for Whaleport’s transition to 100% renewable energy while safeguarding marine ecosystems and the cultural livelihoods of local fishing communities. Created for the **Big Data Analytics for Sustainable Development** course at Hult International Business School.

## 📘 Project Summary

Whaleport faces a conflict: offshore wind turbine installations risk disrupting marine biodiversity and fishing economies. Our team developed a **three-pronged strategy** rooted in big data, sustainability frameworks, and community participation:

1. **Community-Owned Renewable Energy Co-ops**  
2. **Blue-Tech Education & Job Skilling Hub**  
3. **Eco-Marine Zoning via Shared Governance**

We applied tools like stakeholder mapping, triple bottom line (TBL) analysis, GIS-informed marine zoning, and global case comparisons to create a scalable, just energy transition plan.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods

- **Big Data Analysis** — historical energy trends, resource assessments, biodiversity risks  
- **Triple Bottom Line & PESTLE Frameworks**  
- **Stakeholder Surveys** — 80% of fishers identified cultural identity as the top concern  
- **Case Study Modeling** — Denmark’s Middelgrunden, Burlington VT, Costa Rica  
- **Scenario Mapping** — seasonal biodiversity zones, turbine-fishing conflicts  
- **Impact Forecasting** — co-op economics, species migration, job displacement

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- 🐟 **Cultural identity**, not just economic loss, is the core concern of fishing communities.  
- 🌊 Adaptive marine zoning must protect spawning grounds (e.g., Atlantic cod Q2) and allow shared governance.  
- ⚡ Community co-ownership models increase trust, reduce backlash, and align profit with local stewardship.  
- 📈 Renewable transition must include **digital skilling** and **youth inclusion** to future-proof the workforce.  
- 📊 TBL alignment supports SDG 7 (Clean Energy), 8 (Decent Work), 13 (Climate Action), and 14 (Life Below Water).
